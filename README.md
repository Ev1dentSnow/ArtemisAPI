REST API for the Artemis School Management System written in the Django Rest Framework for Python

## Acknowledgements

Although the actual coding part of this project was done by myself, would like to pay tribute to one person

- [@MikeRomaa](https://github.com/MikeRomaa) for showing me the ropes around Django and the Django Rest Framework for the backend. He's a real expert at this framework with a lot of experience under his belt with it, and helped me to understand many concepts before I started using this framework
